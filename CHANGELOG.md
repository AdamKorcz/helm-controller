# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 0.0.6 (2020-09-02)

This prerelease adds support for Helm charts from `GitRepository` sources,
improvements for a more graceful failure recovery, and an upgrade of Helm
from `v3.0.0` to `v3.0.1`. It includes several (breaking) changes to the
API.

The `spec` of the `HelmRelease` has a multitude of breaking changes:

* `spec.chart` (which contained the template for the `HelmChart` template)
  has moved one level down to `spec.chart.spec`. This matches the pod
  template defined in the Kubernetes `Deployment` kind, and allows for
  adding e.g. a `spec.chart.metadata` field in a future iteration to be
  able to define annotations and/or labels.
* The `spec.chart.name` field has been renamed to `spec.chart.spec.chart`,
  and now accepts a chart name (for charts from `HelmRepository` 
  sources) or a path (for charts from `GitRepository` sources), to follow
  changes made to the `HelmChart` API.
* The `spec.chart.spec.sourceRef.kind` is now mandatory, and accepts both
  `HelmRepository` and `GitRepository` values.

The `status` object has two new fields to help end-users and automation
(tools) with observing state:

* `observedStateReconciled` represents whether the observed state of the
  has been successfully reconciled. This field is marked as `true` on a
  `Ready==True` condition, and only reset on `generation`, values, and/or
  chart changes.
* `lastObservedTime` reflects the last time at which the `HelmRelease` was
  observed. This can for example be used to observe if the `HelmRelease` is
  running on the configured `spec.interval` and/or reacting to `ReconcileAt`
  annotations.

## 0.0.5 (2020-08-26)

This prerelease adds support for conditional remediation on failed Helm
actions, and includes several (breaking) changes to the API:

* The `maxRetries` value should now be set on the respective
  `install.remediation.retries` and `upgrade.remediation.retries` fields.
* The `rollback.enable` field has been removed in favour of
  `upgrade.remediateLastFailure`.
* Failing Helm tests will now result in a `False` `Ready` condition by
  default, ignoring test failures can be re-enabled by configuring
  `test.ignoreFailures` to `true`.

## 0.0.4 (2020-08-20)

This prerelease adds support for merging a flat single value from
a `ValueReference` at the defined `TargetPath`, and fixes a bug in
the merging of values where overwrites of a map with a flat single
value was not allowed.

## 0.0.3 (2020-08-18)

This prerelease upgrades the `github.com/fluxcd/pkg/*` dependencies to
dedicated versioned modules, and makes the `api` package available as
a dedicated versioned module.
